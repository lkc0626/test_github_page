I'm an Assistant Professor in [the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science](http://eecs.utk.edu/) at [the University of Tennessee, Knoxville](https://www.utk.edu/). I received my Ph.D. in [Computer Science](https://www.cs.umd.edu) from [the University of Maryland, College Park](https://www.umd.edu) in May 2020 where I worked with Prof. [Tudor Dumitras](http://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~tdumitra/). 

My research interests include **computer security** (data-driven security and usable security), **computer networks** (Internet measurement), and the **Web**. I am interested in identifying the root causes of security threats by understanding the actors (e.g., adversary and end-users) involved, with *data-driven* and *human-centered* perspectives (i.e., usability study).

I was awarded an [NSF CAREER award](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2440819&HistoricalAwards=false) (2025), [NSA Best Scientific Cybersecurity Paper](https://cps-vo.org/group/sos/papercompetition) (2017) and [the Ann G. Wylie Dissertation Fellowship](https://gradschool.umd.edu/funding/student-fellowships-awards/ann-g-wylie-dissertation-fellowship) (2019). My works about the Code-Signing PKI have been featured in Ars Technica, The Register, Schneier on Security, Threatpost, etc. 

<i class="fa fa-star" aria-hidden="true"></i> **I am actively looking for self-motivated a PhD student, undergraduate students, and visiting scholars. Please email me if you're interested in web security (particularly, phishing attacks)**.
